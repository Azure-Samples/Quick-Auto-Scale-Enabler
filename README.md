# Quick-Auto-Scale-Enabler

A simple tool (having command-line and UI) which was first internally created so as to allow programmatic control of Azure CosmosDb containers (at the time of writing, Azure CosmosDb did not have a public offering that supported this).

This tool runs out of the box. It also demonstrates programmatic authentication via CLI, pulling up subscriptions, CosmosDb accounts and containers.

Requirements: Azure CLI for authentication.
